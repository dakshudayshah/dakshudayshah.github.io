                    <div class="bigger">
                    <p>I recently moved to the United States from India. I have an M.B.A. from the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/iift-ranked-among-top-15-best-b-schools-for-2020/articleshow/74519070.cms" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Foreign Trade</a> and a Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering from <a href="http://www.djsce.ac.in/Common/Uploads/ContentTemplate/149_Down_Rankings%20with%20NIRF.pdf" target="_blank">D.J. Sanghvi, University of Mumbai</a>. In India, I worked in Product and Operations Management at <a href="https://www.adityabirla.com" target="_blank">Aditya Birla Group</a>, in their <a href="http://www.abfrl.com" target="_blank">Fashion and Retail Division</a> for 3 years before moving to the US to join my wife, <a href="https://jhaverijaynee.wixsite.com/mysite" target="_blank">Jaynee</a>.

                    <p>I am curious about understanding Human Behavior, and Technology's influence on it. I love reading, mostly Science Fiction and Business. I listen to Hans Zimmer and Ramin Djawadi on repeat. My friends say that I am a good listener, highly analytical, and a good communicator. Nowadays, I am an amateur <a href="https://anchor.fm/dollar-gujarati" target="_blank">podcaster</a> waiting for my work permit (it really is very slow!). I am actively interviewing for Product Management positions in the Tech Industry, so please send me a <a href="mailto:daksh.uday.shah@gmail.com" target="_blank">note</a> if you know someone who's hiring.</p>

                    <h2>What I've Done</h2>
                    <hr>

                    <h3>Product Manager, <a href="https://www.vanheusenindia.com" target="_blank">Van Heusen India</a></h3>
                    <p>I was the Brand Product Manager in charge of the suits category - so if you bought a suit from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-pYaDNIHbY" target="_blank">Van Heusen Fall'19 collection</a>, I worked on bringing that suit to you. I learnt a lot in this role - conducting consumer research, bringing together cross-functional teams, making pricing decisions and devising go-to-market strategies.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Regional Operations Manager, <a href="https://www.peopleonline.co.in" target="_blank">PEOPLE</a></h3>
                    <p>I was appointed as P&L Manager for West India for PEOPLE, a new fast fashion brand from Aditya Birla. I experienced first hand the excitement and challenge of growing a new fashion brand. I developed and implemented plans to maximize sales and expense metrics, hired and developed a team of 17 Store Managers and 100+ Sales Associates and visited 30+ cities in West India to evaluate new retail locations for our stores. Be sure to read my account of the Retail Rollercoaster <a href="https://medium.com/@kshad.shah/retail-rollercoaster-ddd9eeea3601?sk=b1914fc993a1baa15edbfe7b3ca4958f" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Summer Associate, <a href="https://gep.com/" target="_blank">GEP Worldwide</a></h3>
                    <p>Bagged a Consulting internship on my first job interview. This was the first time I worked with MS Excel and realized that most multi-billion dollar businesses are run on spreadsheets. I also helped a US Chemical giant save some money.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Advisory Member of the Board of Directors, <a href="https://knowmyworld.org" target="_blank">Know My World</a></h3>
                    <p>I helped raise corporate sponsorships that enabled 60+ teachers and 2000+ middle school students from 30 countries have digital exchange programs. I was invited to the Board of Directors to advise on financial sustainability and marketing.</p>

                    <h2>When I've Failed</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Quick note: All too often, people highlight their successes and hide their failures. I believe this contributes to impostor syndrome and a toxic culture of one-upmanship. I personally have failed many times at many things. I hope by sharing some of my failures here, I can help change the perception about failure both for myself and others.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Deep Green</a></h3>
                    <p>In Jun’19, I took the leap to leave the comfort of my job and shifted to America to join my wife and work on my idea for a long distance relationship app full time. It was scary to come to another country with no reputation to back me here. But I persevered, spoke to users and tested multiple hypotheses to build a prototype. However, the startup failed to take off. During this phase, I even got the chance to meet successful entrepreneurs from Y-Combinator and investors in the Bay Area and learn from them. They helped me understand that, perhaps, I had taken on too much without having a personal network in the US. Introspection also highlighted gaps in my technical knowledge and business skills required to run a successful, scalable technology enabled business. As the last 10 months unravelled, I faced many hardships and uncontrollable events - a shortage of relevant skills, visa uncertainty, financial hardships, and now a pandemic. But I haven’t lost my courage. Despite setbacks and false starts, I take each challenge as a learning experience.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Picostone Distributorship</a></h3>
                    <p>To test my business acumen, I invested my savings to sell Smart Home IoT devices to dealers in satellite cities of Mumbai. While I could leverage my retail business development experience, negotiating and educating dealers for a new product category was painful. I managed to sell my inventory within 2 months while keeping my day job. While I did not make any profits, I got vital lessons in distribution and sales.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h2>Projects</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Quick note: I enjoy working on side projects like these to pursue my curiosity. We have just the one life, and I don't want to have regrets on my deathbed.</p>
                    </br>

                    <p>I needed to build my network in America. I also wanted to learn how Immigrant Entrepreneurs had made it in this land of opportunity. So with my wife, Jaynee Jhaveri, and my friend Atit Kothari, I launched a podcast to interview successful Immigrant entrepreneurs and professionals in America. We talk with them about their ideas and stories in America, and hope to learn from the struggles they faced. Hosting this podcast has improved my communication skills by leaps and bounds, and given me access to the thinking of some of the most successful people in the US.</p>
